# [Azimuth](http://github.com/mcrider/azimuth)

Azimuth is a simple, elegant, and fast CMS built using meteor.js.

***Note: Azimuth is currently in early alpha; I'm still working out code design and many features are not yet implemented.***

## Prerequisites


* Install meteor.js: `curl https://install.meteor.com | /bin/sh`
* Install meteorite: `sudo npm install -g meteorite`

You can then run Azimuth by cloning this repository and running `mrt` from the root directory.  This will make Azimuth accessible from http://localhost:3000 by default.
